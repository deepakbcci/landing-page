          Mobile application development is the process of making software for
          smartphones, tablets and digital assistants, most commonly for the
          Android and iOS operating systems. The software can be preinstalled on
          the device, downloaded from a mobile app store or accessed through a
          mobile web browser.

        <h1>UI/UX</h1>
        <p>
          While the end product requires consideral input from both design
          methodologies, the process of designing UI and UX is very different.
          UX design mostly deals with the user's entire journey to solve a
          problem. On the other hand, UI design is focused on how the product
          looks and feels when the problem is being solved.

          rents car to earn. My mother is a home-maker. They both love their
          occupation. That’s I have learned from my parents the value of time,
          honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose. We are three
          brothers and sisters. Being the eldest I am the most liable from my
          brothers and sisters. I am wanted to guide and take care of my other
          siblings. We all studied in the different school. Reading is my
          passion.
